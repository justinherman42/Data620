       " '“And you, Sphinx.',\n",
       " 'Now.”  “Sam,” said Alleras, “this is Archmaester Marwyn.”  Marwyn wore a chain of many metals around his bull’s neck.',\n",
       " 'Save for that, he looked more like a dockside thug than a maester.',\n",
       " 'His head was too big for his body, and the way it thrust forward from his shoulders, together with that slab of jaw, made him look as if he were about to tear off someone’s head.',\n",
       " 'Though short and squat, he was heavy in the chest and shoulders, with a round, rock-hard ale belly straining at the laces of the leather jerkin he wore in place of robes.',\n",
       " 'Bristly white hair sprouted from his ears and nostrils.',\n",
       " 'His brow beetled, his nose had been broken more than once, and sourleaf had stained his teeth a mottled red.',\n",
       " 'He had the biggest hands that Sam had ever seen.',\n",
       " 'When Sam hesitated, one of those hands grabbed him by the arm and yanked him through the door.',\n",
       " 'The room beyond was large and round.',\n",

       " 'There was something queer about it.',\n",
       " 'The flame did not flicker, even when Archmaester Marwyn closed the door so hard that papers blew off a nearby table.',\n",
       " 'The light did something strange to colors too.',\n",
       " 'Whites were bright as fresh-fallen snow, yellow shone like gold, reds turned to flame, but the shadows were so black they looked like holes in the world.',\n",
       " 'Sam found himself staring.',\n",
       " 'The candle itself was three feet tall and slender as a sword, ridged and twisted, glittering black.',\n",
       " '“Is that ; ?”  “; obsidian,” said the other man in the room, a pale, fleshy, pasty-faced young fellow with round shoulders, soft hands, close-set eyes, and food stains on his robes.',\n",
       " '“Call it dragonglass.” Archmaester Marwyn glanced at the candle for a moment.',\n",
       " '“It burns but is not consumed.”  “What feeds the flame?” asked Sam.',\n",
       " '“What feeds a dragon’s fire?” Marwyn seated himself upon a stool.',\n",
       " '“All Valyrian sorcery was rooted in blood or fire.',\n",
       " 'The sorcerers of the Freehold could see across mountains, seas, and deserts with one of these glass candles.',\n",
       " 'They could enter a man’s dreams and give him visions, and speak to one another half a world apart, seated before their candles.',\n",
       " 'Do you think that might be useful, Slayer?”  “We would have no more need of ravens.”  “Only after battles.” The archmaester peeled a sourleaf off a bale, shoved it in his mouth, and began to chew it.',\n",
       " '“Tell me all you told our Dornish sphinx.',\n",
       " 'I know much of it and more, but some small parts may have escaped my notice.”  He was not a man to be refused.',\n",
       " 'Sam hesitated a moment, then told his tale again as Marywn, Alleras, and the other novice listened.',\n",
       " '“Maester Aemon believed that Daenerys Targaryen was the fulfillment of a prophecy ; her, not Stannis, nor Prince Rhaegar, nor the princeling whose head was dashed against the wall.”  “Born amidst salt and smoke, beneath a bleeding star.',\n",
       " 'I know the prophecy.” Marwyn turned his head and spat a gob of red phlegm onto the floor.',\n",
       " '“Not that I would trust it.',\n",
       " 'Gorghan of Old Ghis once wrote that a prophecy is like a treacherous woman.',\n",

       " 'Prophecy will bite your prick off every time.” He chewed a bit.',\n",

       " '“Aemon would have gone to her if he had the strength.',\n",
       " 'He wanted us to send a maester to her, to counsel her and protect her and fetch her safely home.”  “Did he?” Archmaester Marwyn shrugged.',\n",
       " '“Perhaps it’s good that he died before he got to Oldtown.',\n",
       " 'Elsewise the grey sheep might have had to kill him, and that would have made the poor old dears wring their wrinkled hands.”  “Kill him?” Sam said, shocked.',\n",
       " '“Why?”  “If I tell you, they may need to kill you too.” Marywn smiled a ghastly smile, the juice of the sourleaf running red between his teeth.',\n",
       " '“Who do you think killed all the dragons the last time around?',\n",
       " 'Gallant dragonslayers armed with swords?” He spat.',\n",
       " '“The world the Citadel is building has no place in it for sorcery or prophecy or glass candles, much less for dragons.',\n",
       " 'Ask yourself why Aemon Targaryen was allowed to waste his life upon the Wall, when by rights he should have been raised to archmaester.',\n",
       " 'His blood was why.',\n",
       " 'He could not be trusted.',\n",

       " 'If I were you, I would do it quickly.',\n",
       " 'A time will come when you’ll be needed on the Wall.” He turned to the pasty-faced novice.',\n",
       " '“Find Slayer a dry cell.',\n",
       " 'He’ll sleep here, and help you tend the ravens.”  “B-b-but,” Sam sputtered, “the other archmaesters ; the Seneschal ; what should I tell them?”  “Tell them how wise and good they are.',\n",
       " 'Tell them that Aemon commanded you to put yourself into their hands.',\n",

       " 'But say nothing of prophecies or dragons, unless you fancy poison in your porridge.” Marwyn snatched a stained leather cloak off a peg near the door and tied it tight.',\n",
       " '“Sphinx, look after this one.”  “I will,” Alleras answered, but the archmaester was already gone.',\n",

       " 'She was the blood of the dragon, and the fire was in her.',\n",
       " 'She had sensed the truth of it long ago, Dany thought as she took a step closer to the conflagration, but the brazier had not been hot enough.',\n",

       " 'Her vest had begun to smolder, so Dany shrugged it off and let it fall to the ground.',\n",

       " 'Now, she thought, now, and for an instant she glimpsed Khal Drogo before her, mounted on his smoky stallion, a flaming lash in his hand.',\n",
       " 'He smiled, and the whip snaked down at the pyre, hissing.',\n",

       " 'Only death can pay for life.',\n",
       " 'And there came a second crack, loud and sharp as thunder, and the smoke stirred and whirled around her and the pyre shifted, the logs exploding as the fire touched their secret hearts.',\n",
       " 'She heard the screams of frightened horses, and the voices of the Dothraki raised in shouts of fear and terror, and Ser Jorah calling her name and cursing.',\n",
