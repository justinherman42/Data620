       " 'A castle must have towers wherever two walls meet at an angle, for defense.',\n",
       " 'The Valyrians fashioned these towers in the shape of dragons to make their fortress seem more fearsome, just as they crowned their walls with a thousand gargoyles instead of simple crenellations.” He took her small pink hand in his own frail spotted one and gave it a gentle squeeze.',\n",

       " 'In the pride of his youth, he had worn it easily, but now it seemed heavy to him, the metal cold against his skin.',\n",
       " '“They are larger than other ravens, and more clever, bred to carry only the most important messages.',\n",
       " 'This one came to tell us that the Conclave has met, considered the reports and measurements made by maesters all over the realm, and declared this great summer done at last.',\n",
       " 'Ten years, two turns, and sixteen days it lasted, the longest summer in living memory.”  “Will it get cold now?” Shireen was a summer child, and had never known true cold.',\n",
       " '“In time,” Cressen replied.',\n",
       " '“If the gods are good, they will grant us a warm autumn and bountiful harvests, so we might prepare for the winter to come.” The smallfolk said that a long summer meant an even longer winter, but the maester saw no reason to frighten the child with such tales.',\n",
       " 'Patchface rang his bells.',\n",

       " 'But not for years yet, I pray, and then not for long.',\n",
       " '“Ah, here is Pylos with the bird.”  Shireen gave a cry of delight.',\n",
       " 'Even Cressen had to admit the bird made an impressive sight, white as snow and larger than any hawk, with the bright black eyes that meant it was no mere albino, but a truebred white raven of the Citadel.',\n",
       " '“Here,” he called.',\n",
       " 'The raven spread its wings, leapt into the air, and flapped noisily across the room to land on the table beside him.',\n",

       " 'He had stopped to catch his breath and ease the pain in his hip when he heard the scuff of boots on stone, and came face-to-face with Ser Davos Seaworth, descending.',\n",
       " 'Davos was a slight man, his low birth written plain upon a common face.',\n",
       " 'A well-worn green cloak, stained by salt and spray and faded from the sun, draped his thin shoulders, over brown doublet and breeches that matched brown eyes and hair.',\n",
       " 'About his neck a pouch of worn leather hung from a thong.',\n",
       " 'His small beard was well peppered with grey, and he wore a leather glove on his maimed left hand.',\n",
       " 'When he saw Cressen, he checked his descent.',\n",
       " '“Ser Davos,” the maester said.',\n",
       " '“When did you return?”  “In the black of morning.',\n",
       " 'My favorite time.” It was said that no one had ever handled a ship by night half so well as Davos Shorthand.',\n",
       " 'Before Lord Stannis had knighted him, he had been the most notorious and elusive smuggler in all the Seven Kingdoms.',\n",
       " '“And?”  The man shook his head.',\n",
       " '“It is as you warned him.',\n",
       " 'They will not rise, Maester.',\n",
       " 'Not for him.',\n",
       " 'They do not love him.”  No, Cressen thought.',\n",
       " 'Nor will they ever.',\n",
       " 'He is strong, able, just ; aye, just past the point of wisdom ; yet it is not enough.',\n",
       " 'It has never been enough.',\n",
       " '“You spoke to them all?”  “All?',\n",
       " 'No.',\n",
       " 'Only those that would see me.',\n",
       " 'They do not love me either, these highborns.',\n",
       " 'To them I’ll always be the Onion Knight.” His left hand closed, stubby fingers locking into a fist; Stannis had hacked the ends off at the last joint, all but the thumb.',\n",
       " '“I broke bread with Gulian Swann and old Penrose, and the Tarths consented to a midnight meeting in a grove.',\n",
       " 'The others—well, Beric Dondarrion is gone missing, some say dead, and Lord Caron is with Renly.',\n",
       " 'Bryce the Orange, of the Rainbow Guard.”  “The Rainbow Guard?”  “Renly’s made his own Kingsguard,” the onetime smuggler explained, “but these seven don’t wear white.',\n",
       " 'Each one has his own color.',\n",
       " 'Loras Tyrell’s their Lord Commander.”  It was just the sort of notion that would appeal to Renly Baratheon; a splendid new order of knighthood, with gorgeous new raiment to proclaim it.',\n",
       " 'Even as a boy, Renly had loved bright colors and rich fabrics, and he had loved his games as well.',\n",
       " '“Look at me!” he would shout as he ran laughing through the halls of Storm’s End.',\n",
       " '“Look at me, I’m a dragon,” or “Look at me, I’m a wizard,” or “Look at me, look at me, I’m the rain god.”  The bold little boy with wild black hair and laughing eyes was a man grown now, one-and-twenty, and still he played his games.',\n",
       " 'Look at me, I’m a king, Cressen thought sadly.',\n",
       " 'Oh, Renly, Renly, dear sweet child, do you know what you are doing?',\n",
       " 'And would you care if you did?',\n",
       " 'Is there anyone who cares for him but me?',\n",
       " '“What reasons did the lords give for their refusals?” he asked Ser Davos.',\n",
       " '“Well, as to that, some gave me soft words and some blunt, some made excuses, some promises, some only lied.” He shrugged.',\n",
       " '“In the end words are just wind.”  “You could bring him no hope?”  “Only the false sort, and I’d not do that,” Davos said.',\n",
       " '“He had the truth from me.”  Maester Cressen remembered the day Davos had been knighted, after the siege of Storm’s End.',\n",
       " 'Lord Stannis and a small garrison had held the castle for close to a year, against the great host of the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne.',\n",
       " 'Even the sea was closed against them, watched day and night by Redwyne galleys flying the burgundy banners of the Arbor.',\n",
       " 'Within Storm’s End, the horses had long since been eaten, the dogs and cats were gone, and the garrison was down to roots and rats.',\n",
       " 'Then came a night when the moon was new and black clouds hid the stars.',\n",
       " 'Cloaked in that darkness, Davos the smuggler had dared the Redwyne cordon and the rocks of Shipbreaker Bay alike.',\n",
       " 'His little ship had a black hull, black sails, black oars, and a hold crammed with onions and salt fish.',\n",
       " 'Little enough, yet it had kept the garrison alive long enough for Eddard Stark to reach Storm’s End and break the siege.',\n",
       " 'Lord Stannis had rewarded Davos with choice lands on Cape Wrath, a small keep, and a knight’s honors ; but he had also decreed that he lose a joint of each finger on his left hand, to pay for all his years of smuggling.',\n",
       " 'Davos had submitted, on the condition that Stannis wield the knife himself; he would accept no punishment from lesser hands.',\n",
       " 'The lord had used a butcher’s cleaver, the better to cut clean and true.',\n",
       " 'Afterward, Davos had chosen the name Seaworth for his new-made house, and he took for his banner a black ship on a pale grey field—with an onion on its sails.',\n",
       " 'The onetime smuggler was fond of saying that Lord Stannis had done him a boon, by giving him four less fingernails to clean and trim.',\n",
       " 'No, Cressen thought, a man like that would give no false hope, nor soften a hard truth.',\n",
       " '“Ser Davos, truth can be a bitter draught, even for a man like Lord Stannis.',\n",
       " 'He thinks only of returning to King’s Landing in the fullness of his power, to tear down his enemies and claim what is rightfully his.',\n",
       " 'Yet now ;”  “If he takes this meager host to King’s Landing, it will be only to die.',\n",
       " 'He does not have the numbers.',\n",
       " 'I told him as much, but you know his pride.” Davos held up his gloved hand.',\n",
       " '“My fingers will grow back before that man bends to sense.”  The old man sighed.',\n",
       " '“You have done all you could.',\n",
       " 'Now I must add my voice to yours.” Wearily, he resumed his climb.',\n",
       " 'Lord Stannis Baratheon’s refuge was a great round room with walls of bare black stone and four tall narrow windows that looked out to the four points of the compass.',\n",
       " 'In the center of the chamber was the great table from which it took its name, a massive slab of carved wood fashioned at the command of Aegon Targaryen in the days before the Conquest.',\n",
       " 'The Painted Table was more than fifty feet long, perhaps half that wide at its widest point, but less than four feet across at its narrowest.',\n",
       " 'Aegon’s carpenters had shaped it after the land of Westeros, sawing out each bay and peninsula until the table nowhere ran straight.',\n",
       " 'On its surface, darkened by near three hundred years of varnish, were painted the Seven Kingdoms as they had been in Aegon’s day; rivers and mountains, castles and cities, lakes and forests.',\n",
       " 'There was a single chair in the room, carefully positioned in the precise place that Dragonstone occupied off the coast of Westeros, and raised up to give a good view of the tabletop.',\n",
       " 'Seated in the chair was a man in a tight-laced leather jerkin and breeches of roughspun brown wool.',\n",
       " 'When Maester Cressen entered, he glanced up.',\n",
       " '“I knew you would come, old man, whether I summoned you or no.” There was no hint of warmth in his voice; there seldom was.',\n",
       " 'Stannis Baratheon, Lord of Dragonstone and by the grace of the gods rightful heir to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, was broad of shoulder and sinewy of limb, with a tightness to his face and flesh that spoke of leather cured in the sun until it was as tough as steel.',\n",
       " 'Hard was the word men used when they spoke of Stannis, and hard he was.',\n",
       " 'Though he was not yet five-and-thirty, only a fringe of thin black hair remained on his head, circling behind his ears like the shadow of a crown.',\n",
       " 'His brother, the late King Robert, had grown a beard in his final years.',\n",
       " 'Maester Cressen had never seen it, but they said it was a wild thing, thick and fierce.',\n",
       " 'As if in answer, Stannis kept his own whiskers cropped tight and short.',\n",
       " 'They lay like a blue-black shadow across his square jaw and the bony hollows of his cheeks.',\n",
       " 'His eyes were open wounds beneath his heavy brows, a blue as dark as the sea by night.',\n",
       " 'His mouth would have given despair to even the drollest of fools; it was a mouth made for frowns and scowls and sharply worded commands, all thin pale lips and clenched muscles, a mouth that had forgotten how to smile and had never known how to laugh.',\n",
       " 'Sometimes when the world grew very still and silent of a night, Maester Cressen fancied he could hear Lord Stannis grinding his teeth half a castle away.',\n",
       " '“Once you would have woken me,” the old man said.',\n",
       " '“Once you were young.',\n",
       " 'Now you are old and sick, and need your sleep.” Stannis had never learned to soften his speech, to dissemble or flatter; he said what he thought, and those that did not like it could be damned.',\n",
       " '“I knew you’d learn what Davos had to say soon enough.',\n",
       " 'You always do, don’t you?”  “I would be of no help to you if I did not,” Cressen said.',\n",
       " '“I met Davos on the stair.”  “And he told all, I suppose?',\n",

       " 'The storm lords will not rise for me.',\n",
       " 'It seems they do not like me, and the justice of my cause means nothing to them.',\n",

       " 'The bold ones have already declared for Renly.',\n",

       " 'I never asked for Dragonstone.',\n",
       " 'I never wanted it.',\n",
       " 'I took it because Robert’s enemies were here and he commanded me to root them out.',\n",
       " 'I built his fleet and did his work, dutiful as a younger brother should be to an elder, as Renly should be to me.',\n",

       " 'He names me Lord of Dragonstone, and gives Storm’s End and its incomes to Renly.',\n",
       " 'Storm’s End belonged to House Baratheon for three hundred years; by rights it should have passed to me when Robert took the Iron Throne.”  It was an old grievance, deeply felt, and never more so than now.',\n",
       " 'Here was the heart of his lord’s weakness; for Dragonstone, old and strong though it was, commanded the allegiance of only a handful of lesser lords, whose stony island holdings were too thinly peopled to yield up the men that Stannis needed.',\n",
       " 'Even with the sellswords he had brought across the narrow sea from the Free Cities of Myr and Lys, the host camped outside his walls was far too small to bring down the power of House Lannister.',\n",
       " '“Robert did you an injustice,” Maester Cressen replied carefully, “yet he had sound reasons.',\n",
       " 'Dragonstone had long been the seat of House Targaryen.',\n",
       " 'He needed a man’s strength to rule here, and Renly was but a child.”  “He is a child still,” Stannis declared, his anger ringing loud in the empty hall, “a thieving child who thinks to snatch the crown off my brow.',\n",
       " 'What has Renly ever done to earn a throne?',\n",
       " 'He sits in council and jests with Littlefinger, and at tourneys he dons his splendid suit of armor and allows himself to be knocked off his horse by a better man.',\n",
       " 'That is the sum of my brother Renly, who thinks he ought to be a king.',\n",
       " 'I ask you, why did the gods inflict me with brothers?”  “I cannot answer for the gods.”  “You seldom answer at all these days, it seems to me.',\n",
       " 'Who maesters for Renly?',\n",
       " 'Perchance I should send for him, I might like his counsel better.',\n",
       " 'What do you think this maester said when my brother decided to steal my crown?',\n",
       " 'What counsel did your colleague offer to this traitor blood of mine?”  “It would surprise me if Lord Renly sought counsel, Your Grace.” The youngest of Lord Steffon’s three sons had grown into a man bold but heedless, who acted from impulse rather than calculation.',\n",
       " 'In that, as in so much else, Renly was like his brother Robert, and utterly unlike Stannis.',\n",
       " '“Your Grace,” Stannis repeated bitterly.',\n",
       " '“You mock me with a king’s style, yet what am I king of?',\n",
       " 'Dragonstone and a few rocks in the narrow sea, there is my kingdom.” He descended the steps of his chair to stand before the table, his shadow falling across the mouth of the Blackwater Rush and the painted forest where King’s Landing now stood.',\n",
       " 'There he stood, brooding over the realm he sought to claim, so near at hand and yet so far away.',\n",
       " '“Tonight I am to sup with my lords bannermen, such as they are.',\n",
       " 'Celtigar, Velaryon, Bar Emmon, the whole paltry lot of them.',\n",
       " 'A poor crop, if truth be told, but they are what my brothers have left me.',\n",
       " 'That Lysene pirate Salladhor Saan will be there with the latest tally of what I owe him, and Morosh the Myrman will caution me with talk of tides and autumn gales, while Lord Sunglass mutters piously of the will of the Seven.',\n",
       " 'Celtigar will want to know which storm lords are joining us.',\n",
       " 'Velaryon will threaten to take his levies home unless we strike at once.',\n",
       " 'What am I to tell them?',\n",
       " 'What must I do now?”  “Your true enemies are the Lannisters, my lord,” Maester Cressen answered.',\n",
       " '“If you and your brother were to make common cause against them—”  “I will not treat with Renly,” Stannis answered in a tone that brooked no argument.',\n",
       " '“Not while he calls himself a king.”  “Not Renly, then,” the maester yielded.',\n",
       " 'His lord was stubborn and proud; when he had set his mind, there was no changing it.',\n",
       " '“Others might serve your needs as well.',\n",
       " 'Eddard Stark’s son has been proclaimed King in the North, with all the power of Winterfell and Riverrun behind him.”  “A green boy,” said Stannis, “and another false king.',\n",
       " 'Am I to accept a broken realm?”  “Surely half a kingdom is better than none,” Cressen said, “and if you help the boy avenge his father’s murder—”  “Why should I avenge Eddard Stark?',\n",
       " 'The man was nothing to me.',\n",
       " 'Oh, Robert loved him, to be sure.',\n",
       " 'Loved him as a brother, how often did I hear that?',\n",
       " 'I was his brother, not Ned Stark, but you would never have known it by the way he treated me.',\n",
       " 'I held Storm’s End for him, watching good men starve while Mace Tyrell and Paxter Redwyne feasted within sight of my walls.',\n",
       " 'Did Robert thank me?',\n",
       " 'No.',\n",
       " 'He thanked Stark, for lifting the siege when we were down to rats and radishes.',\n",
       " 'I built a fleet at Robert’s command, took Dragonstone in his name.',\n",
       " 'Did he take my hand and say, Well done, brother, whatever should I do without you?',\n",
       " 'No, he blamed me for letting Willem Darry steal away Viserys and the babe, as if I could have stopped it.',\n",
       " 'I sat on his council for fifteen years, helping Jon Arryn rule his realm while Robert drank and whored, but when Jon died, did my brother name me his Hand?',\n",
       " 'No, he went galloping off to his dear friend Ned Stark, and offered him the honor.',\n",
       " 'And small good it did either of them.”  “Be that as it may, my lord,” Maester Cressen said gently.',\n",
       " '“Great wrongs have been done you, but the past is dust.',\n",
       " 'The future may yet be won if you join with the Starks.',\n",

       " 'Service as a page might have done him good, but that damnable Lannister woman had Lord Arryn poisoned before it could be done, and now Lysa hides him in the Eyrie.',\n",
       " 'She’ll never part with the boy, I promise you that.”  “Then you must send Shireen to the Eyrie,” the maester urged.',\n",
       " '“Dragonstone is a grim home for a child.',\n",
       " 'Let her fool go with her, so she will have a familiar face about her.”  “Familiar and hideous.” Stannis furrowed his brow in thought.',\n",
       " '“Still ; perhaps it is worth the trying ;”  “Must the rightful Lord of the Seven Kingdoms beg for help from widow women and usurpers?” a woman’s voice asked sharply.',\n",
