    "## Mapping tweets to political party\n",
    "Above Dataframe contains tweets by republican and democratic congress members. I wanted to know if we can look at the tweets themselves, and determine if the member who created the tweet was a democrat or a republican. Some of the tweets are retweets. I am going to operate under the assumption that retweets are likely to still represent values that relate to the party.  This may be a poor assumption, and we likely should just analyze non retweets or attempt to determine the differences between the sets, but as this is an introductory attempt to use NLP to determine party preference, we will assume retweets by a representative are likely to represent their party ideology.  \n",
